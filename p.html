  CSS Abbreviations
  While Emmet abbreviations are good for generating HTML, XML
  or any other structured markup, it may look useless for CS
  S. You don’t want to write CSS selectors and transform them
  to CSS selectors, right? The only thing Emmet can do for you is
  to provide shorthands for CSS properties, but editors with native
   snippets and autocomplete can help you way better.
  Actually, Emmet has something to offer.

<p>
  For CSS syntax, Emmet has a lot of predefined snippets for prop
  erties. For example, you can expand m abbreviation to get margin: ;
  snippet. But you don’t want just margin property, you want to specify
  a value for this property. So you have to manually type, let’s say, 10px.
  Emmet can greatly optimize your workflow here: you can inject
  value directly into abbreviation. To get margin: 10px; you can
  simply expand the m10 abbreviation. Want multiple values? Use a
  hypen to separate them: m10-20 expands to margin: 10px 20px;.
  Negative values? No problem: precede the
  first value with hyphen and all
